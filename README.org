This is **WIP*. This are my notes about Gaussian  Mixture Models and EM.

Please visiti notebook: [[file:intro_to_gmm_&_em.ipynb][Gaussian Mixture Models]]

* Explanation about GMM n EM algorithm

  The code is broken

* When to use or apply

  You want to clusterize data (unsupervised learn)
  
* Simple explanation

  Ex: The case of speaker recognition

  * One GMM per speaker (those are my models)
  * GMM gives you the probability of that MFCC belongs to the speaker
